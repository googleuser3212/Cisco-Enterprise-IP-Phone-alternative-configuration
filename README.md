This repository contains configuration files for Cisco Enterprise IP Phones, with the intent of registering them to asterisk or another third party system. These files are for when some of the other config templates do not work. The most common template that I have found online has not always worked with certain Cisco phone models, specifically the DX-650, Cius, 6921, 7841, 8851, and the 8845. 

In another repository, I may include my other template that I have, that one is the more commonly distributed file for configuring these phones. 

You do not need to install the usecallmanager patch on asterisk to make the phones work on the system, however you may be missing certain features.

**Please read the comment at the top of the file before using. It contains information on what you need to modify in the file to make the phones work. I would also recommend going through the file more thoroughly to see what options you want to enable and disable on the phones. **

Eventually, I will include the other supporting files. Right now, I don't have those available, but eventually I will make it available. I will also make available the list of ringtones that I have set up for my phones, as well as the ringlist.xml files.
